# FileWatcher
Hello viewer

i have given the file name as filewatcher.py
it will check for the given search string and if found it will move to the determined location  and if its found and same file present in determined location it will show "File already exist", if string not found it will return "string not found"
watch.py is used to watch the 'abc' folder untill its terminated and it will encounter all changes done in the folder 

Thanks
